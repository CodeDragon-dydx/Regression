## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

* The dataset has 506 rows and 14 columns.

* The column/variable names' explanation is given below:

1) __CRIM :__ Per capita Crime rate by town

2) __ZN :__ Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

3) __INDUS :__ Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

4) __CHAS :___ Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

5) __NOX :__ nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

6) __RM :__ average number of rooms per dwelling

7) __AGE :__ proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

8) __DIS :__ weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

9) __RAD :__ index of accessibility to radial highways

10) __TAX :__ full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

11) __PTRATIO :__ pupil-teacher ratio by town

12) __B :__ 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of African-Americans by town

13) __LSTAT :__ Percentage of the population in the lower economic status 

14) __MEDV  :__ Median value of owner-occupied homes in multiples of $1000

#Scatter Plot

     ylab = "Median House Price",
     xlab = "Percentage of people in lower economic strata",
     main = "Housing Price vs Status"
     )

plot(housing_data$ZN, housing_data$MV,
     ylab = "Median House Price",
     xlab = "per capita Crime rate by town",
     main = "Housing Price vs Crime Rate"
     )

plot(housing_data$NOX, housing_data$MV,
     ylab = "Median House Price",
     xlab = "Nitric Oxides Concentration",
     main = "Housing Price vs Nitric Oxides Concentration"
     )

plot(housing_data$AGE, housing_data$MV,

```
#Housing Price vs Status  - shows a negative correlation, as Percentage of people in lower economic strata increases Median House Price decreases

#Housing Price vs Crime Rate - There are very few points that has per capita crime rate by town > 30

#Housing Price vs Nitric Oxides Concentration - This graph is not much useful. Though it has a downward trend, it is not continuous.There is also lot of variance around the trend

#Housing Price vs Owner Occupied Units - As the owner occupied units increases median housing price reduces. Proportion of owner occupied units are more after 40. However, there is also a lot of variance

#Housing Price vs Average # of rooms -  Seems like there is a linear relationship


###Correlation plot
```{r}

library(corrplot)

correlation_XPairwise = cor(housing_data, use = "complete.obs")

corrplot(correlation_XPairwise, method = "number")
```
#There is a strong negative correlation between Housing price and Economic Strata. However,we cannot confirm as Correlation IS NOT Causation

#There is a strong positive correlation between average rooms per dwelling and housing price

#The other variables are moderately correlated with the dependent variable

#There is a chance of multi collinearity because you can see many independent variables have strong correlation
