## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

```
## Data Description

* The dataset is from a bank, using which we have to predict whether the subject subscribes to a term deposit or not

* The dataset has the following attributes:

1 - age (numeric)

2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","unknown","unemployed","management","housemaid","entrepreneur","student",                              "blue-collar","self-employed","retired","technician","services") 

3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)

4 - education (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")

5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")

6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric) 

7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")

8 - loan: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")

9 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular") 

10 - day: last contact day of the month (numeric)

11 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")

12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)

13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)

14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)
  
15 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)

16 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")

__Response Variable (desired target):__

17 - y - has the client subscribed to a __term deposit?__ (binary: "yes","no")
